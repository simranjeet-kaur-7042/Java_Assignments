//Create a program to print the greatest factor of a number beside itself using a loop.
//Hint => Get an integer input and assign it to the number variable. As well as define a greatestFactor variable and assign it to 1
//Create a for loop that runs from last but one till 1 as in i = number - 1 to i = 1.
//Inside the loop, check if the number is perfectly divisible by i then assign i to greatestFactor variable and break the loop.
//Display the greatestFactor variable outside the loop
